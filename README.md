This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company. The primary focus is to investigate the factors contributing to customer attrition, including contract types, payment methods, and pricing structures. Through comprehensive data analysis, we identified which specific contracts are associated with higher churn rates and presented our findings to provide actionable insights.
